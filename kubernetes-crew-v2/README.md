## 🛠️ Setup & Configuration

### Terraform Configuration

To deploy your Kubernetes Crew, use the following Terraform configuration:

```hcl
# Core Configuration
variable "teammate_name" {
  description = "Name of the Kubernetes crew teammate"
  type        = string
  default     = "k8s-watcher"
}

variable "kubiya_runner" {
  description = "Runner (cluster) to use for the teammate"
  type        = string
}

variable "notification_channel" {
  description = "Primary Slack channel for notifications"
  type        = string
  default     = "#devops-oncall"
}

# Access Control
variable "kubiya_groups_allowed_groups" {
  description = "Groups allowed to interact with the teammate"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["Admin"]
}
```

### Example Deployment

```hcl
module "k8s_crew" {
  source = "kubiya/kubernetes-crew/module"

  teammate_name             = "k8s-watcher"
  kubiya_runner            = "production-cluster"
  notification_channel     = "#k8s-alerts"
  kubiya_groups_allowed_groups = ["Admin", "DevOps", "SRE"]
}
```

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `teammate_name` | Your K8s crew teammate identifier | k8s-watcher |
| `kubiya_runner` | Target Kubernetes cluster for deployment | Required |
| `notification_channel` | Slack channel for alerts and notifications | #devops-oncall |
| `kubiya_groups_allowed_groups` | Authorized groups for teammate interaction | ["Admin"] |

## 💬 Example Interactions

### Scenario 1: Pod Troubleshooting
```markdown
You: @k8s-crew Check why pods in payment-service are crashing

Crew: 🔍 Analyzing payment-service pods:
1. Checking restart counts
2. Retrieving recent logs
3. Verifying resource consumption
4. Analyzing events

Found: Memory pressure in pod payment-service-785bf
Action: Adjusting resource limits and restarting pods
Would you like to see the detailed logs?
```

### Scenario 2: Resource Scaling
```markdown
You: @k8s-crew Scale the authentication deployment to 5 replicas

Crew: Executing scaling operation:
- Current replicas: 3
- Target replicas: 5
- Namespace: default
- Deployment: authentication

Scaling in progress...
✅ Successfully scaled. Monitoring deployment rollout...
```

### Scenario 3: Cluster Health Check
```markdown
You: @k8s-crew How's our cluster doing?

Crew: 📊 Cluster Health Report (Last 24h):
- Nodes: 8/8 Healthy
- Pod Success Rate: 99.8%
- Resource Utilization: 72%
- Recent Events: 2 automatic scaling events
- Alert: High memory usage in namespace: analytics

Would you like details about any specific component?
```
